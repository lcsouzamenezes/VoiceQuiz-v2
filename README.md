This repository contains the Quiz app developed in React Native.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

react-native

### Installing

Use the following command to initialise the project:
`npm init`

Run `npm install` to install the required node modules. This should create a node_modules directory and a package-lock.json in your project root directory.

Navigate to the /android directory and run `gradlew clean` to build the project.

## Deployment

### Android
In the project root directory, run `react-native run-android` to build and run the project on an emulator or a connected device.

Note: To build the project on an android device, you must have android SDK installed and 'adb' added to your PATH system variable.

### iOS
In the project root directory, run `react-native run-ios` to build and run the project on an emulator or a connected device.

Note: To build the project on an iOS device, you require the machine running the macOS, and XCode installed.
